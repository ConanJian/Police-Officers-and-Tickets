This Repository is here to hold my code for my Resume
All of this code came from a project I did for my CS1400 class at Cal Poly Pomona
I did change the code a little bit(I added one line so far, to improve my code)

All the code done is in Java. 
I used notepad to make all of this code, but I will use the Eclipse IDE
to confirm if the code works as intended.

I did not write the ParkingTicketText code, the test case was provided by my teacher and so was the pdf.
